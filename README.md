# Let's order some burgers

This toy app demonstrates a practical application of Ai Struct to implement the principles of Natural Language Design: 

* Only give the user free text input
* Provide the user cues to guide them
* Convert the user input into structured entities and relationships (using Ai Struct)
* Match the user input to the required database entities & fields
* Create the appropriate relationships between entities
* Use context specific default values to fill in missing data
* Give the user the opportunity to correct any misunderstandings or change their mind

This app is currently live at https://tbd.com

Voice to text:
* The voice to text functionality has only been tested on Chrome so you may need to type in the text for voice orders if your browser doesn't support "webkitSpeechRecognition".
* The voice to text functionality defaults to the top language preference in your browser settings e.g. en-US
* Check the browser console when starting speech capture to see what's going on.
