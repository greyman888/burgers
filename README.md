# Let's order some burgers

This toy app demonstrates a practical application of Ai Struct to implement the principles of Natural Language Design: 

* Only give the user free text input
* Provide the user cues to guide them
* Convert the user input into structured entities and relationships (using Ai Struct)
* Match the user input to the required database entities & fields
* Create the appropriate relationships between entities
* Use context specific default values to fill in missing data
* Give the user the opportunity to correct any misunderstandings or change their mind
